# Aida AI Assistant

Aida is a sophisticated AI assistant that combines voice interaction, text processing, and memory capabilities to provide a natural and context-aware conversational experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status Warning

**IMPORTANT: This project is in early development and is NOT production-ready!**

- üöß **Active Development**: This project is under heavy development and changes frequently
- üêõ **Bugs Expected**: You will encounter bugs, crashes, and incomplete features
- ‚öóÔ∏è **Experimental**: Many features are experimental and may not work as expected
- üîß **Breaking Changes**: Updates may include breaking changes without notice
- ‚ö° **Unstable**: Core functionality may be unstable or entirely non-functional

### Known Limitations
- Voice recognition may be unreliable
- Memory system is experimental and slow
- Limited error handling
- Incomplete documentation

**Use at your own risk! This is currently a proof-of-concept and learning project.**

## Features

- Voice and text interaction modes
- Wake word detection ("Jarvis")
- Real-time speech-to-text processing
- Natural text-to-speech responses
- Long-term memory and context awareness
- Web search capabilities
- Conversation history management
- Multi-user support

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker (for Qdrant vector database)
- Required API keys:
  - ElevenLabs (TTS)
  - Deepgram (STT)
  - Picovoice (Wake word)
  - Anthropic Claude (LLM)
  - Perplexity (Web search)
  - OpenAI (Embeddings)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BurtTheCoder/aida.git
cd aida
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

5. Start Qdrant database:
```bash
cd storage
docker-compose up -d
```

6. Initialize memory system:
```bash
python setup_memory.py
```

## Usage

### Running the Assistant

Basic usage:
```bash
python main.py
```

Available command-line arguments:
- `--mode`: Choose between 'voice' or 'text' mode (default: voice)
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging
- `--no-tts`: Disable text-to-speech in text mode
- `--user-id`: Specify user ID for memory persistence

Examples:
```bash
# Run in text mode
python main.py --mode text

# Run with debug logging
python main.py --debug

# Run for specific user
python main.py --user-id user123
```
